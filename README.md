   The purpose of the Multiple_year_stock_data analyis was to take a detailed look on how stocks fluctuated over a time span of 3 years 2018-2020.
Each stock was categorized by date, open, high, low, close and stock volume. Stocks were alphabetized. The stocks were then analyzed closely to examine the yearly change , percentage change and total volume stock by each individual stock. Data was placed in a Summary table to the right of the raw data. A second summary table was also placed to the far to examine the greatest increase, greatest decrease, and greatest total volume from all of the stocks. 

  These results can be very useful to understand the market and make educated financial decisions for business or personal gain. The yearly change column is highlighted on on each worksheet to show the stocks that were in the red(negative yearly changes) and in the green(positive yearly changes).
